# Contributing

Pull Requests welcome! We welcome contributions for bugs, as well as additional learning materials to showcase on the website.

## The Five Golden Rules

The simple steps of contributing to any GitHub project are as follows:

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/reactjs-id/reactjs.id/fork)
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b username/my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push -u origin username/my-new-feature`
5. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/reactjs-id/reactjs.id/pulls)

## Developing

A nodejs >= 6.0.0 setup with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is recommended.

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# ...or, for npm
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8000
npm start

# build for production
npm run build

# build for production and push to gh-pages branch
npm run deploy
```
